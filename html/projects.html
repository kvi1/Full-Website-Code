                <h5>1) Cybersecurity Portfolio</h5>
                <p>In the summer of 2023, I was able to complete Google's course on Cybersecurity. Part of the course was quizzes and videos hearing from Google security analysts, and
                    the other part was a set of labs. The labs included things like security audits, file permissions, SQL, and queries, all of which is contained
                    in this portfolio.
                </p>

                <h5>2) Password Generator</h5>
                <p>Developed in Python, and using key elements such as user input, strings, ASCII, conditionals, and others, this is a random
                    password generator. Based on the type of password the user wants, the program outputs a password with or without a custom phrase
                    if the user wants one, and lets the user know if the password is weak, medium, or strong.

                <h5>3) This Website</h5>
                <p>With a combination of HTML and CSS, this website was made possible. The source code for the website will be made public soon.</p>
                <h5>4) Caesar Cipher</h5>
                <p> Implemented in C++, this is the famous Caesar Cipher program, where an inputted string is outputted with the proper shift. A 
                    pretty popular Cybersecurity program too!

                        <h5>  Projects In Development 🔧 </h5>
                <p>Building on my first ever calculator project using t=tkinter in Python.  Additionally, a studying app using React.js and Typescript coming soon too
                    which will be finished in around April. I really want to gain experience with APIs so that is the reason for this project. Other ideas as they come into my mind will be created and posted on this website too!
